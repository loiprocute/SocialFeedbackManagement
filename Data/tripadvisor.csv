tonypeezy,Saw Saigon Poke on facebook and was of course skeptical since it recently opened its doors. What a pleasant surprise! Im from California so we have some really great Poke restaurants and Saigon Poke is up there with the best. The environment itself is nice and the service is really attentive with the servers offering insight as to what combination suits your pallet most. This is especially important for new Poke consumers. For me Ive had it many times before so I went straight for the Norwegian Imported salmon bowl with spicy mayo and every topping. Salmon was out of this world fresh and went great with the spicy mayo sauce. Overall great experience. Been back twice and will be back often.

Also love the upbeat and quick service staff!!; The place is small but charming and comfy, the staff is very friendly, and the service pretty quick!; Value-for-money wise it is definitely better than the poke places i used to go in Singapore. i highly reco this place to all healthy food lovers in HCMC.",POSITIVE,0.9997223019599916,5,2017-02-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor

lanquan,"Maybe I've been in Vietnam for too long, but I felt this is comparable to what I can get in California if not better. Not only that, but the base price of 150k/$7 would be cheaper than anything I can get in the US. They rotate different toppings every once in awhile so it's refreshing to have new options. They make the fruit juice every morning with no additives, and they taste amazing. I'm grateful to have this as a healthy option because I don't get enough protein with my diet in Vietnam. The quality in the fish is amazing, the staff is friendly, atmosphere is nice, and the location in the coffee apartment on Nguyen Hue is perfect.

maryyeo,"Poke (pronounced 'po-kay') has been quite a craze in Singapore and we're glad to find a joint here in HCMC. I find it a much wholesome version compared to the salad/juice fad since this is good quality, healthily prepared food that won't make you go hungry after an hour.; ; 150,000vnd (~6.5usd) is actually much cheaper than many of the famous salad bars in Singapore that we usually pay upward of 10bucks for. So each bowl of Poke consists of:; - good portion of Japanese sushi white rice/brown rice; - 2 ice-cream scoopfuls of tuna/salmon sashimi or cooked shrimp; - selection of Japanese sauces (our fav is the sesame sauce); - a whole range of healthy toppings... and you can choose all of them! For the sake of our preschooler, we only got the tomatoes, mushrooms, edamame, surimi and seaweed. The guacamole looked good at an additional 10,000vnd.; ; We were happy that our even preschooler liked and ate a lot of it. Not easy to please our picky eater so...good job. I also liked the friendly service girl. Hope that it can open up as a kiosk in D7 for the health-conscious families!",POSITIVE,0.9922863245010376,5,2017-05-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor

Poke Saigon was not only the first but also arguably has set the bar very high for the kind of quality any competitors would need to meet.; ; Poke Saigon is located in an interesting building, heritage, and can be somewhat difficult to find although it is located on the very popular and busy street Nguyen Hue. Seating is quite sparse as most of their business is takeaway or delivery via services like Vietnammm.; ; They offer a Subway style of make your own Poke bowls or try their pre-made choices which are all very delicious in their own right. I love that they never scrimp on toppings and often times the bowl seems way too small for the amount they give. (in fact i've told them to get bigger bowls). Great for vegetarians and health conscious people, they offer white rice or brown rice and salad as a base.; ; The options of tuna, salmon, or shrimp are always fresh never fishy. Always fresh. The veggies are always crisp, rinsed, and green. Out of all the ingredients they offer i've never seen a non-fresh one. Poke Saigon is about as good as it gets.

We were looking for some options on Trip Advisor and this place popped up. It was only a few hundred meters from where we were, so decided to go there. The restaurant is part of a building which has many other shops. At first we walked past the building, but thanks for Google Maps we went back. There is a very small sign amongst many other signs in front of the building (so very easy to miss). The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor. Since we were extremely tired we decided to wait for the elevator. But after waiting 5 or so minutes we decided to just climb up. The restaurant was very fresh and looked new. There were several people sitting. We saw the menu and liked the idea of make your own poke. You could select from several mains, sides, toppings, etc.. The person helping us was really nice. I went with Sushi rice, salmon and spicy salmon (she let me mix my two scoops). The sauces were very nice as well. My wife went with their vegetarian option (tofu) along with several toppings.; ; The food tasted as good as it looked and we were extremely glad we found this place after our long and tiring day.

ShiJay,"Decided to eat at Poke having read reviews on Trip advisor and I must say we weren't disappointed. There is a cafe like feel to the place with a very simple, clever concept for serving you with delicious and healthy food. I am reticent to call this a fast food place because everything on offer is healthy and very fresh, but it is important to note that because of the concept, food is served fast. I found the prices quite reasonable for what was on offer and the two staff members on duty the night we were visited were extremely courteous and efficient.; The place is not obviously located, one has to go into a narrow building and climb up two flights of stairs to get to restaurant. There were some people trying to charge you an 'elevator fee', don't pay for it, just take the staira. The 'elevator fee' had all the signs of a potential scam but I can't say for sure.",POSITIVE,0.9943922162055968,5,2018-01-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor

You can choose one tipe of fish or tofu (2 scoops, pay more if you want more scoops) and a base, and you can add so colorful toppings for free. I chase the salmon (was delicious) and the brown rice base (delicious too) with many vegetables and toppings to make it the more colorful I could.; The staff is so friendly and smily, I definitely will recommend you to try it at least once, but also twice or more times!",POSITIVE,0.997778594493866,5,2018-07-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor

Gry H,This one deserves its rating cause it’s so good! Even though it’s a salad bar it has truly a lot of good choices. It’s also very hidden so you have to go up some stairs that doesn’t look like it’s going to this magical place but when you’re there you’ll know. It’s not too big though so wouldn’t bring the whole family but a group of 5 - 10 is probably okay if it’s not busy. Would recommend!,POSITIVE,0.9997264742851256,5,2018-07-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor

wawrus,"Poke Saigon is clean and inviting, but perhaps a bit hard to find. The entrance is through a scooter parking area and up a flight of stairs and down a corridor. Once we found it though, we were greeted with decent choices for salad and grain bases, poke of many sorts, and lots of toppings and sauces, all for a reasonable price. The only objection: the bowls could be bigger, not in terms of quantity of food----the bowls were filling and tasty---but in terms of being too tight for mixing. The staff were friendly and helpful.

wader,"What a revelation....I had picked this place for lunch as it was near our hotel (The reverie) It was a bit hard to find and if not for one picture I had seen on here of the entrance, we may not have found it. Its in the building that looks like an old apartment, with various businesses on many floors. You walk into the building off the street and it doesn't look like your walking into anything, but once you take the elevator up or walk up the stairs you start to see the businesses. Poke was on the second floor, and was a very small shop. It was well worth the effort as it was kind of like a subway (for us NA) where you picked your base (salad, brown rice, sticky rice or combo of each) and then added the ingredients you wanted. It was so simple, but so yummy. It was so good we came back the next day for lunch again. If you are anywhere nearby make the effort to find it.

samramirza,"I had read amazing reviews of poke and decided I would try out during my few fats in Saigon. Unfortunately, on my first night,; I couldn’t find it. This is because I have no sense of direction and didn’t appreciate the fact that it wasn’t staring at me from the Main road, but that I had to spot the sign and go up some stairs! I didn’t let my lack of finding it put me off. I messaged poke on Facebook and wasn’t sent clear directions, a map etc and the next night, I found it and am so glad we did. I was with my 14 year old son who loves creating his own concoctions of food. We both really enjoyed putting our bowls together.

Staff speaks English perfectly well and it was nice to have an introduction before we started picking our choices. The decor is also great and they have comfortable seats.; ; For 150K dong, it was a little steep but considering the generosity of the food selections and freshness of the ingredients, I would say it is value for money.

The poke bowl is at the back of the “hotel” on the 1st or 2nd. There’s plenty of comfy seating inside. Now to the poke bowls, they were absolutely delicious! The spicy salmon and spicy tuna were amazing and you can literally pick as many toppings as you want, all of the toppings were delicious too.

Liveandsee23,"I obviously live on another planet looking at the other reviews. I went today for lunch given all the hype but for me it was good but not amazing. Their located in The Cafe Apartments on the main Walking Street in Saigon (second floor). Small branch, limited seating. Think wooden seats, beach vibe Hawaii. I stupidly went at peak period lunchtime 13:00. Suggest going outside of main mealtimes. I luckily got a seat. You can eat in or take out. The line was long with two members of staff who were trying their best. More a place to eat and go rather than linger for ages. There were only two suggested 'ready-made' options. None appealed to me. I think if they have more ready-made choices, lines would be less. Most people like me made their own bowls which obviously took longer. Those that went for the suggested ready-made standard options were a lot quicker. Choose your base, I had salad which was lettuce leaves and then your toppings. There was a nice variety of toppings. What made me laugh was they had already run out of salmon! It was only 13:00. This is the most popular poke! They had other marinated salmon but I wanted the plain salmon so did others! I was surprised. I had tuna then. The regular option is two scoops which is enough. Just be mindful and make it clear if you have dietary restrictions. Staff were not very clear on this. Toppings ranged from mango to crab salad and quail eggs! Ingredients were fresh but some of the lettuce leaves were turning brown. Some toppings had an additional cost and if you choose quinoa as a base, this was also extra. They actually weigh the poke! My bowl was light and healthy as I chose the salad and avoided the heavy sauces and toppings. If you have the sushi rice, the portion size is generous and it will be quite filling. The bowls were well presented and pretty. Instagram lovers will have a ball! There are spoons or chopsticks to eat with plus soft drinks and water. Not sure about alcohol or tea. The fresh watermelon juice was to die for. So good! Better than the poke! No sugar and 100% juice. Really refreshing. It isn't cheap but poke never is. Staff try their best to keep the place clean. It was nice but this was definitely not the best poke I have eaten. I would recommend going but I wouldn't say this is like a top poke place having travelled much of the world. They don't accept AMEX. Would suggest looking online or at instagram before going and deciding on your toppings to make it easier. It's easy to get carried away otherwise!",,,4,2023-03-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor

Mary N,"Though I loved the Vietnamese food on my trip, by the end I was craving fresh, healthy light food. So I was happy to find Poke Saigon. It's inside an old apartment building on the 3rd floor. When I went it was during lunch hour so the wait was a bit long. And by the time I ordered some items were sold out like the spiced tuna. There's a lot to choose from - raw salmon and tuna, crab meat, veggies, choice of rice, salads, sauces. Too many choices! It's not the cheapest of meals (190,000) but will definitely keep you full for awhile unlike Vietnamese food where I'm constantly hungry! You can also get it packed to take away if you can't finish it. It looks like a small bowl but it's quite substantial!",POSITIVE,0.9967281818389891,4,2023-08-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor
