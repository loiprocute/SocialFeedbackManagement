tonypeezy,Saw Saigon Poke on facebook and was of course skeptical since it recently opened its doors. What a pleasant surprise! Im from California so we have some really great Poke restaurants and Saigon Poke is up there with the best. The environment itself is nice and the service is really attentive with the servers offering insight as to what combination suits your pallet most. This is especially important for new Poke consumers. For me Ive had it many times before so I went straight for the Norwegian Imported salmon bowl with spicy mayo and every topping. Salmon was out of this world fresh and went great with the spicy mayo sauce. Overall great experience. Been back twice and will be back often.

maryyeo,"Poke (pronounced 'po-kay') has been quite a craze in Singapore and we're glad to find a joint here in HCMC. I find it a much wholesome version compared to the salad/juice fad since this is good quality, healthily prepared food that won't make you go hungry after an hour.; ; 150,000vnd (~6.5usd) is actually much cheaper than many of the famous salad bars in Singapore that we usually pay upward of 10bucks for. So each bowl of Poke consists of:; - good portion of Japanese sushi white rice/brown rice; - 2 ice-cream scoopfuls of tuna/salmon sashimi or cooked shrimp; - selection of Japanese sauces (our fav is the sesame sauce); - a whole range of healthy toppings... and you can choose all of them! For the sake of our preschooler, we only got the tomatoes, mushrooms, edamame, surimi and seaweed. The guacamole looked good at an additional 10,000vnd.; ; We were happy that our even preschooler liked and ate a lot of it. Not easy to please our picky eater so...good job. I also liked the friendly service girl. Hope that it can open up as a kiosk in D7 for the health-conscious families!",POSITIVE,0.9922863245010376,5,2017-05-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor

Not only that, but the base price of 150k/$7 would be cheaper than anything I can get in the US. They rotate different toppings every once in awhile so it's refreshing to have new options. They make the fruit juice every morning with no additives, and they taste amazing. I'm grateful to have this as a healthy option because I don't get enough protein with my diet in Vietnam. The quality in the fish is amazing, the staff is friendly, atmosphere is nice, and the location in the coffee apartment on Nguyen Hue is perfect.

Saigon-Foody,"Being the first is always risky but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained. Poke Saigon was not only the first but also arguably has set the bar very high for the kind of quality any competitors would need to meet.; ; Poke Saigon is located in an interesting building, heritage, and can be somewhat difficult to find although it is located on the very popular and busy street Nguyen Hue. Seating is quite sparse as most of their business is takeaway or delivery via services like Vietnammm.; ; They offer a Subway style of make your own Poke bowls or try their pre-made choices which are all very delicious in their own right. I love that they never scrimp on toppings and often times the bowl seems way too small for the amount they give. (in fact i've told them to get bigger bowls). Great for vegetarians and health conscious people, they offer white rice or brown rice and salad as a base.; ; The options of tuna, salmon, or shrimp are always fresh never fishy. Always fresh. The veggies are always crisp, rinsed, and green. Out of all the ingredients they offer i've never seen a non-fresh one. Poke Saigon is about as good as it gets. They are planning on opening a D2 location and i hope also expand the variety of fish they offer. I order Poke once a week from these guys.

We were looking for some options on Trip Advisor and this place popped up. It was only a few hundred meters from where we were, so decided to go there. The restaurant is part of a building which has many other shops. At first we walked past the building, but thanks for Google Maps we went back. There is a very small sign amongst many other signs in front of the building (so very easy to miss). The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor. Since we were extremely tired we decided to wait for the elevator. But after waiting 5 or so minutes we decided to just climb up. The restaurant was very fresh and looked new. There were several people sitting. We saw the menu and liked the idea of make your own poke. You could select from several mains, sides, toppings, etc.. The person helping us was really nice. I went with Sushi rice, salmon and spicy salmon (she let me mix my two scoops). The sauces were very nice as well. My wife went with their vegetarian option (tofu) along with several toppings.; ; The food tasted as good as it looked and we were extremely glad we found this place after our long and tiring day.

There is a cafe like feel to the place with a very simple, clever concept for serving you with delicious and healthy food.

I found the prices quite reasonable for what was on offer and the two staff members on duty the night we were visited were extremely courteous and efficient.; The place is not obviously located, one has to go into a narrow building and climb up two flights of stairs to get to restaurant.

You walk into the building off the street and it doesn't look like your walking into anything, but once you take the elevator up or walk up the stairs you start to see the businesses. Poke was on the second floor, and was a very small shop. It was well worth the effort as it was kind of like a subway (for us NA) where you picked your base (salad, brown rice, sticky rice or combo of each) and then added the ingredients you wanted.

emanuelaboh,"Carina l’idea della ciotola in cui combinare riso stile sushi e vari ingredienti crudi: pesce, verdure, frutta, salse e topping croccante. Da bere succhi freschi senza aggiunte. Il risultato è un piatto buono e salutare. Ho dato 3 pallini perché il prezzo è alto rispetto alla tipologia di locale (no servizio) e alla quantità, quindi non ci si sente pienamente soddisfatti e si ha la sgradevole impressione di pagare l’idea trendy.

The restaurant is kept clean, has bright natural lighting and nice decor. The protein choices are basic, but there are many add ons and sauces to make a beautiful healthy bowl of Poke.

JayL6767,여기 점원은 너무나 불친절했습니다. 손님이 많아서 바빠서 그런지 퉁명스럽게 “그거 없어요. 안돼요. 또 뭐할건데요?” 심지어 자기가 못알아듣는 영어는 무시하고 그냥 들이붓습니다. 포케의 장점은 베이스부터 토핑까지 원하는 재료를 골라 먹을 수 있다는 건데... 선택하려고 하면 짜증스럽게 반응하더라구요. 그러고서는 나중에 뭐 필요한거 있으면 더 주겠다고 하는데 다시는 오고싶지도 않고 남들 추천해주고 싶지도 않습니다. 양도 양이지만 더 화가난 건 재료의 질도 별로였어요. 구체적으로 상호를 말하긴 그렇지만 만 동 추가해서 다른 곳에 신선한 포케 포함된 뷔페드세요. 그게 훨 나을거 같아요.,NEGATIVE,0.9894519448280334,1,2019-08-01 00:00,ko,tripadvisor

pauliiiiina,Highly recommend! A friend and I stumbled upon this place while exploring District 1. We had both been eating strictly Vietnamese food for weeks and having this was like a little throwback to western culture. It was delicious and worth the western prices. I think after currency exchange it works out as being £5 per bowl which is still half the price you would pay anywhere in London. 10/10 and would love to go again.,POSITIVE,0.9996008276939392,5,2019-08-01 00:00,en,tripadvisor
jackbrhudson,"This was my first experience with Poke and it was great! It's essentially Subway but healthier and more delicious. I came because it said they had gluten free options on TripAdvisor - although the menu board doesn't say this explicitly, it's easy to see what's going into your food and there is no cross contamination. A bowl costs 150k and is very filling - you can add as much or as little as you like! The staff were all very friendly and spoke good English.

samramirza,"I had read amazing reviews of poke and decided I would try out during my few fats in Saigon. Unfortunately, on my first night,; I couldn’t find it. This is because I have no sense of direction and didn’t appreciate the fact that it wasn’t staring at me from the Main road, but that I had to spot the sign and go up some stairs! I didn’t let my lack of finding it put me off. I messaged poke on Facebook and wasn’t sent clear directions, a map etc and the next night, I found it and am so glad we did. I was with my 14 year old son who loves creating his own concoctions of food. We both really enjoyed putting our bowls together.
